# merkle-tree

A merkle tree implementation in Rust. The routines use a flat in-order binary tree defined in [this blog post](https://mmapped.blog/posts/22-flat-in-order-trees). Supports arbitrary hash sizes, inclusion proof generation/validation and (most likely) second preimage attack mitigation.  

This project is still in progress.
